## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The Medivo project is designed to create a modern, user‑friendly healthcare portal that connects patients with qualified medical professionals across multiple specialties and locations. By offering a comprehensive doctor directory—including profiles with specializations, clinic details, and patient reviews—Medivo makes it easy for users to discover the right provider for their needs. Integrated appointment booking streamlines the scheduling process, allowing patients to choose convenient time slots.

To ensure that Medivo remains a trusted network of qualified professionals, we’ve implemented a “Join Request” workflow for new doctors. Prospective practitioners can submit their credentials—information, specialty details, and clinic name—through a secure online form.
